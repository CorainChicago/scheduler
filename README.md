# scheduler
A tutor scheduling system built with Rails React 

## Tech

The bases of the app is Rails with React on the frontend. I'm using the Rails React Gem to do this. 


## User Story

Each teacher can tutor up to 5 students at a time in 30 minute intervals from 9:00 am to 10:00 pm from Monday through Sunday.  A teacher can add, edit and delete a tutoring slot. 

Students can sign up for up for no more than 10 sessions a week and no more than 3 session with the same teacher.  

After the login page, their are separate scheduling pages for teachers and students.
